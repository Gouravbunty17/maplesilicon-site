# Branding Changes Summary

## Overview
Your website has been updated to properly distinguish between:
- **Maple Silicon Inc.** (the company)
- **SparseFlow™** (the product)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Header (Top Navigation)**
   - **Logo**: Uses `maplesilicon.png` 
   - **Company Name**: "Maple Silicon" text next to logo
   - This establishes the company identity

### 2. **Hero Section (Main Banner)**
   - **Logo**: Uses `sparseflow.png` for product branding
   - **Title**: Changed from "Maple Silicon™" to "SparseFlow™"
   - **Description**: Updated to say "SparseFlow™ is an early-stage compiler platform being developed by Maple Silicon Inc."

### 3. **Throughout the Site**
   - All references changed from "Maple Silicon" to "SparseFlow" for product features
   - Section titles updated (e.g., "The SparseFlow Approach" instead of "The Maple Silicon Approach")
   - Product capabilities now refer to "SparseFlow" consistently

### 4. **Company Section**
   - **Logo**: Uses `maplesilicon.png`
   - **Title**: "About Maple Silicon Inc."
   - **Description**: Clearly states that SparseFlow™ is the company's platform

### 5. **Footer**
   - Copyright: "© 2025 Maple Silicon Inc. All rights reserved."
   - Trademark: "SparseFlow™ is a trademark of Maple Silicon Inc."

## Logo File References

Make sure your logo files are in the correct location:
```
/
├── index.html
├── maplesilicon.png    ← Company logo (for header & footer)
└── sparseflow.png      ← Product logo (for hero/main content)
```

## What to Do Next

1. **Download the updated `index.html` file**
2. **Upload it to your GitHub repository** (replace the current index.html)
3. **Make sure both logo files are in the root directory**:
   - `maplesilicon.png`
   - `sparseflow.png`

## Result

Your website now has a clear hierarchy:
- **Top**: Maple Silicon (company) in header
- **Main Content**: SparseFlow (product) throughout
- **Bottom**: Maple Silicon Inc. in footer with trademark notice

This creates professional brand separation where the company owns the product brand.
